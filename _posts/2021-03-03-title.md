I'm not really sure what goes into these things as this is my first attempt typing anything of the sort, But I am going to give it a go!
This is my first attempt at a blog here on GitHub pages, I am learning computer science and seeing which avenues interest me the most.
I have a completely unrelated day job and a family to look after, so this is something i'm going to be doing in my spare time. 
Hopefully this will help to give me some measure of my progress and maybe inspire some other to do the same
